Important:
Chromium based browsers are no longer supported, expect stuff to break if you use the collection with them.
The extra Ratings and IMDb + TMDb links are removed for the time being.
These changes are for the sake of stability and to make upkeep easier.

Updates:
- You can now properly sort the torrents on a series' page by name, seeds, snatches, size or leeches by clicking on the respective icon / text.
- On a franchise page you now have extensive torrent filters
- Trailers are now pulled from anilist and should work reliably for everyone
